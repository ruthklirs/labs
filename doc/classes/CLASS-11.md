### AMM

B deposits a pair of tokens,  x and y, 100 x and 100 y, so A comes and changes 5 x to y, so now the pool has 95x and 105y, so the price of x increases.

### CDP

A deposits 1 ETH [that has a 3000 USD value] and mints 1000 DAI, where every DAI = 1 USD. If ETH price goes to 1000 USD, liquidators activate their bots to clode the CDP [collateralized debt position]
